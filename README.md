LAB 5&nbsp; ‚îÄ Pointers and arrays

Following the recent two lectures on pointers, this lab contains four major parts: Part I: Pointers and passing address of scalar variables. Part II: Pointer arithmetic. Part III: Pointers and passing char arrays to functions; Part IV: Pointers and passing general arrays to functions.

Part I Pointers and passing address of scalar variables

1. Problem A Subject

Experiencing ‚Äúmodifying scalar arguments by passing addresses/pointers‚Äù.

Specification

Write an ANSI-C program that reads three integers line by line, and modify the input values.

Implementation

Download file lab5A.c to start off.

<ul>
<li>The program reads user inputs from stdin line by line. Each line of input contains 3 integers
separated by blanks. A line that has the first number being -1 indicates the end of input.
</li>
<li>Store the 3 input integers into variable a, b and c;</li>
<li>Function swapIncre() is called in main() with an aim to change the values of a, b and
c in such a way that, after function swapIncre returns, a stores the third input value and

c stores the first input value (i.e., a and c swap values), and b‚Äôs value is doubled.
</li>
<li>Compile and run the program and observe unsurprisingly that the values of a, b and c are
not changed at all (why?).
</li>
<li>Modify the program so that it works correctly, as shown in the sample inputs/outputs below. You should only modify function swapIncre and the statement in main that calls this function.

No global variables should be used.

Sample Inputs/Outputs:

2. Problem A2

Modify program lab5A.c, by defining a new function void swap(‚Ä¶) which swaps the values of a and c. This function should be called in function swapIncre. Specifically, swapIncre()only increases the value of b, and delegates the swapping task to swap().

Sample Inputs/Outputs: Same as above.

Part II Pointer/address arithmetic

C supports some arithmetic operations on pointers. For expression p ¬± n, where p is a pointer and n is an integer, the result is another address (pointer).

Download program lab5B.c and study the code. Then compile and run it several times. You will get different values each time, but you should always observe the following:

<ul>
<li>For pChar which is a pointer to char, expression pChar+1 results in an address (pointer) whose value is the value of pchar + 1. For pShort which is a pointer to short, expression pShort+1 results in an address whose value is the value of pShort + 2; For integer pointerpInt, expressionpInt+1resultsinanaddresswhosevalueisthevalueof pInt+4. For Double pointer pDouble, expression pDouble+1 results in an address whose value is the value of pDouble+8. Likewise, these pointers + 2 result in addresseswhosevaluesaretheoriginalvaluesplus2,4,8and16respectively. Why was C designed this way?</li>
<li>As discussed in class, the rule here is that for a pointer p, arithmetic expression p ¬± n results in an address (pointer) whose value is the value of p ¬± n √ó s where s is the size of the type of the pointee. That is, the result is ‚Äúscaled‚Äù by the size of the pointee type. So for an integer pointer pInt, expression pInt + n results in an address whose value is the value of pInt + n√ó4, assuming size of int is 4 bytes.</li>
<li>This rule is further verified by the outputs for p++, which assign the pointers to resulting addresses, jumping the pointers by 1, 2, 4 and 8 bytes respectively, and the outputs for p += 4, which jump the pointers by 4√ó1, 4√ó2, 4√ó4 and 4√ó8 bytes respectively.</li>
<li>For an array arr, its elements are stored continuously in memory, with arr[0] occupying the lowest address. Since arr is an integer array, each element occupies 4 bytes in memory. So address of arr[i+1] is 4 bytes higher than address of arr[i].</li>
<li>Array name arr contains the address of its first element, consequently arr and &amp;arr[0] contain the same address.</li>
<li>Since array name arr is a pointer, assignment operation ptr = arr assigns ptr the address of the first element of the array, making ptr points to arr[0]. Consequently, ptr, arr and &amp;arr[0] contain the same value.</li>
<li>According to the pointer arithmetic rule above, ptr + i results in an address of value ptr+i√ó4, which is the address of element i of arr. Likewise, since arr contains address of its first element, arr+i results in an address of value arr+i√ó4. As a result, we have the rule that if ptr == arr, then ptr+i == arr+i == &amp;arr[i].</li>

Part III Pointers and passing char arrays to functions Motivation

In C when an array is passed as an argument to a function, it is ‚Äòdecayed‚Äô into a single value which is the (starting) memory address of the array. That is, the function only receives a single address value, rather than the whole array ‚Äî actually the function does not know or care whether the pointee at this address is a single variable or it is the first element of an array, or something else. Thus, a function that expects an int array as argument can specify the parameter (formal argument) either as int[] or int *. Likewise, a function that expects a char array (string) as argument can specify the parameter (formal argument) either as char[] or char *. (See prototype of functions in string.h). In calling the function, you can pass as the actual argument either the array name (which contains the address of its first element), or a pointer to an element of the array. Either way, passing array by address allows the called function to not only access the argument array but also modify it, even it is called-by-value.

Problem C0

Passing char array as argument, and pointer notation in place of array index notation [].

Download the program lab5strlen.c, which shows more than 10 ways to implement strlen(). Read the code and run it, and observe the following:

<ul>
<li>Functions expecting a char array can specify the parameter (formal argument) either as
char [], or, char *.
</li>
<li>Functions expecting a char array can be called by passing either array name or a pointer to
an array element as its actual argument.
</li>
<li>Even a function‚Äôs formal argument is declared as char [], you can always use pointer
notations to manipulate the argument in the function.
</li>
<li>Even a function‚Äôs formal argument is declared as char *, you can always use array
notation [] to manipulate the argument in the function
</li>
<li>Address/pointer arithmetic can be exploited strategically to calculate the string length</li>
<li>Because of ‚Äòdecaying‚Äô, sub-arrays can be passed to a function easily.</li>
<li>By passing sub-arrays, recursion can be exploited to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Based on the fact that array are stored continuously in memory, and assuming the array is
fully populated, the length of an array can be calculated using sizeof operator, with sizeof(arr)/sizeof(char) or sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[i]).
</li>
</ul>
o In case of char array, we subtract 1 to exclude the ‚Äò\0‚Äô.

Note that this approach does not work when used on a pointer variable that points to the array: sizeof ptr gives the size of the pointer variable ptr itself, which is usually 8 bytes.

No submission for this problem.

3.1 Problem C

Subject

Passing char array as argument, accessing argument array. Pointer notion in place of array index notation.

<ul>
<li>Assume that each line of input contains at most 30 characters but it may contain blanks.</li>
<li>Use fgets to read line by line</li>
</ul>
o note that the line that is read in using fgets will contain a new line character ‚Äò\n‚Äô, right before ‚Äò\0‚Äô. Then you either need to exclude it when processing the array, or, remove the trailing new line character before processing the array. One common approach for the latter is replacing the ‚Äò\n‚Äô with ‚Äò\0‚Äô (implemented for you).

Part IV Pointers and passing general arrays to functions

In C when an array is passed into a function, it is ‚Äòdecayed‚Äô into a single memory address. That is, the function only receives a single address value, thus the function does not know or care if the pointee at this address is a single variable or it is the first element of an array. As a result, the function needs info about where the array ends. In the case of a character array (string), the special sentinel character ‚Äò\0‚Äô is used to mark the end of array. For general array, however, you need to provide the function with the length information explicitly. In this section you will explore different approaches to determining the length of an argument array.

Problem E0 Subject

Exploiting array memory size. (Not working).

As implemented in lab5E0.c, one attempt is to get the array length by exploiting the memory size of the array. Specifically, assuming the array is fully populated, then the number of elements can be derived with operation sizeof(array)/sizeof(int).

Compile and run lab5E0.c. Observer that,

<ul>
<li>both the functions receive the correct starting address of the array.</li>
<li>sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int) works in main, giving the length 6.</li>
<li>in both the functions, however, sizeof(formal argument) / sizeof(int) does not
give the correct length of the actual argument array, even when the formal argument is declared as int [].

Think about why this happens. No submissions for this problem.

4.1. Problem E. Using terminator token. Subject

Explore putting a special sentinel token at the end of array, like the case of string.

Specification

Write an ANSI-C program that reads a list of positive integer values (including 0), until EOF is read in, and then outputs the largest value among in the input integers.

Assume there are no more than 20 integers.

Implementation

Download lab5E.c to start with.
</li>
</ul>
‚Ä¢ Keep on reading integers using scanf and a loop, and put the integers into an array, until

EOF is read.

In earlier labs we have experienced how getchar detects end of file. We have used scanf to detect quit but not end of file. So far we have ignored the fact that scanf also has a return value, which is an integer indicating the number of characters read in, and, same as getchar, function scanf also returns EOF if end of file is reached. You can issue man 3 scanf | grep return or

man 3 scanf | grep EOF in the terminal to see details.

<ul>
<li>Note that several input integers can appear on the same line. So far we have used scanf to
read a line of input a time (which contains no spaces). Here you can observe that scanf with a loop can read inputs that appear on the same line, as well as on multiple lines.
</li>

4.2 Problem E2 Passing length info explicitly.

Subject

Passing length info explicitly.

The above approach provides the length info about argument array by putting a special sentinel terminator token at the end of the array, like the case of string. But putting a terminator might not always be possible.

Another approach, which is more common for general arrays, is to pass the length info explicitly to the function (as an additional argument).

Specification

Same problem and requirement as above, but this time suppose the input numbers can be both positive and negative so we could not store a special terminator token in the array.

Implementation

‚Ä¢ Declare and implement function largest(int *, int) and display(int *, int). Same as before, no array index [] should be used in main, except the array declaration. No array index [] should be used in largest and display at all.
